## Prototype Pattern

### Definition

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows creating copies of existing objects without making the code dependent on their classes. It involves creating a prototype object and then creating new instances by copying the prototype. This pattern helps in reducing the need for subclassing and provides a way to create new objects by copying an existing one.

The Prototype Pattern is particularly useful when the cost of creating a new object from scratch is significantly greater than the cost of copying an existing object.

&nbsp;

### Why This Pattern

The Prototype Pattern was created to address the need for efficiently creating new objects by copying existing ones. It avoids the overhead of creating new instances from scratch and allows for dynamic creation of objects at runtime.

### About

> Allows creating copies of existing objects without making the code dependent on their classes.

> Involves defining a prototype object and creating new instances by copying it.

> Reduces the need for subclassing when creating new objects.

> Enables dynamic creation of objects with minimal overhead.

### Model

![Prototype Pattern](https://github.com/fabioono25/design-patterns/blob/main/assets/prototype.png)

&nbsp;

### Advantages

- **Reduced Object Creation Overhead**: Avoids the cost of creating new objects from scratch by copying existing ones.
- **Dynamic Object Creation**: Enables creating new objects with different configurations and states at runtime.
- **Less Subclassing**: Reduces the need for creating subclasses to handle different object variations.

&nbsp;

### Disadvantages

- **Cloning Complexity**: Implementing proper cloning methods can be complex, especially for objects with complex internal structures.
- **Shallow vs. Deep Copying**: Ensuring proper copying of nested objects (deep copy) can introduce additional complexity.

&nbsp;

### Real-World Examples of Use

- **Graphic Editors**: Cloning objects like shapes or images to duplicate them within a graphic editor.
- **Cached Data**: Creating copies of cached data to provide efficient access to frequently used data.
- **Configuration Management**: Creating configuration objects based on existing prototypes with specific settings.

&nbsp;

### Relationship with Other Patterns

- **Abstract Factory**: The Prototype Pattern can be used in conjunction with the Abstract Factory pattern to create and clone families of related objects.

&nbsp;

### How to Replace This Pattern

- **Direct Object Creation**: For simpler scenarios without complex object structures, direct object creation might be sufficient.
- **Factory Method**: In cases where object creation involves additional setup or customization, the Factory Method pattern might be more suitable.

### Examples of Implementation

#### Simple Implementation

The following example demonstrates a simple implementation of the Prototype pattern:

```csharp
public interface IPrototype
{
    IPrototype Clone();
}

public class ConcretePrototype : IPrototype
{
    public int Value { get; set; }

    public IPrototype Clone()
    {
        return new ConcretePrototype { Value = this.Value };
    }
}
