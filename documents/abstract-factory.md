## Abstract Factory Pattern

### Definition

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating **families of related or dependent objects** without specifying their concrete classes. It encapsulates a group of individual factories that share a common theme, allowing clients to create objects without being concerned about their specific implementations.

&nbsp;

### Why This Pattern

The Abstract Factory Pattern was created to address the need for creating families of related objects that work together. It allows the system to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented, promoting flexibility and interchangeability of object implementations.

&nbsp;

### About

> A super-factory that creates other factories.

> Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects.

> Hides the details of object creation, allowing clients to create objects without specifying their concrete classes.

> Often used to ensure that a family of related products is used together.

> Encourages designing interfaces for families of objects rather than concrete classes.

### Model

![Abstract Factory Pattern](https://github.com/fabioono25/design-patterns/blob/main/assets/abstract_factory.png)

&nbsp;

### Advantages

- **Flexibility**: The pattern provides a way to create families of related objects, allowing for easy substitution of different object implementations.
- **Isolation**: Clients use interfaces to create objects, isolating them from the specifics of object creation.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that a family of related products is used together, maintaining consistency in the system's components.

&nbsp;

### Disadvantages

- **Complexity**: Introduces additional complexity due to the creation of multiple interfaces and classes for related objects.
- **Maintenance**: The pattern can lead to an increased number of interfaces and classes, potentially making the codebase more difficult to maintain.

&nbsp;

### Real-World Examples of Use

- **GUI Libraries**: Creating different types of GUI components (buttons, windows, text boxes) for different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) using platform-specific factories.
- **Abstract Document Generators**: Creating documents (PDF, HTML) with different elements (headings, paragraphs, images) using document-specific factories.
- **Vehicle Manufacturing**: Creating families of related vehicle components (engines, tires, interiors) based on vehicle types (sedan, SUV, truck).

&nbsp;

### Relationship with Other Patterns

- **Factory Method**: The Abstract Factory Pattern is often used in conjunction with the Factory Method pattern to create families of related objects.
- **Singleton**: An Abstract Factory can be implemented as a Singleton to ensure a single instance of the factory is used throughout the application.

&nbsp;

### How to Replace This Pattern

- **Direct Instantiation**: In simpler scenarios with fewer variations of objects, direct instantiation of objects might be sufficient.
- **Dependency Injection**: In some cases, Dependency Injection can be used to provide different implementations of objects at runtime.

### Examples of Implementation

#### Simple Implementation

In this example, the IAbstractFactory interface defines methods for creating families of related products (IProductA and IProductB). Concrete factories (ConcreteFactory1 and ConcreteFactory2) implement the factory methods to create specific product instances:

```csharp
public interface IProductA
{
    string OperationA();
}

public interface IProductB
{
    string OperationB();
}

public class ConcreteProductA1 : IProductA
{
    public string OperationA()
    {
        return "ConcreteProductA1";
    }
}

public class ConcreteProductA2 : IProductA
{
    public string OperationA()
    {
        return "ConcreteProductA2";
    }
}

public class ConcreteProductB1 : IProductB
{
    public string OperationB()
    {
        return "ConcreteProductB1";
    }
}

public class ConcreteProductB2 : IProductB
{
    public string OperationB()
    {
        return "ConcreteProductB2";
    }
}

public interface IAbstractFactory
{
    IProductA CreateProductA();
    IProductB CreateProductB();
}

public class ConcreteFactory1 : IAbstractFactory
{
    public IProductA CreateProductA()
    {
        return new ConcreteProductA1();
    }

    public IProductB CreateProductB()
    {
        return new ConcreteProductB1();
    }
}

public class ConcreteFactory2 : IAbstractFactory
{
    public IProductA CreateProductA()
    {
        return new ConcreteProductA2();
    }

    public IProductB CreateProductB()
    {
        return new ConcreteProductB2();
    }
}
