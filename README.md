# Design Patterns

The idea is to organize all design patterns (GoF and no GoF) in a series of definitions and examples.


## Design Principles

> Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

> Program to an interface, not an implementation

> Favor composition over inheritance
